### Motivation

We wished to use this project as an opportunity to shed light on some serious issues we are facing globally. Among these were issues like animal rights, environmental threats, human rights, and terrorism. According to a survey, about 218 million people are affected by calamities, natural and man-made, per annum and about 68000 people lose their lives every year. The frequency of natural disasters like earthquakes, volcanoes, etc have remained broadly constant, but the number of terrorist activities have grown over the period. Thus terrorism seemed like an appropriate issue to bring up. Also, we tried to look for data sources for all those issues and found readily available detailed data for global terrorism that would supplement our analysis.

### Project Objectives

A user would learn about the trend in terrorist activities around the world and how the terrorist activities have impacted different countries/cities in world in last 40 years. Through our visualisation, we are trying to answer questions like which countries are the most disturbed due to terrorism, the terror outfits that are most active/disruptive and how they have evolved over the years. The objective is to educate users about where and when terrorist activities have impacted most and is it increasing or decreasing over time.

### Data

The data we have is taken from the Global Terrorism Dataset and can be requested for here:
